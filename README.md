# js-drumkit

A plain javascript drumkit that utilises the HTML 'data-' attribute to play a sound file on key press and change some css classes.

what I learned:
  const is essentially a read only variable.
  the 'data-' attribut is for custom attributes
  .delay() only works on animations, not functions.
